Welcome and thank you for visiting this project.  This project will evolve 
over time with the main goal of developing tools that assist beings who 
choose to act as free agents in the existing markets.  My inital goal is 
to create a decentralized web app that provides a trustless environment to 
coordinate the purchase of services, secure submission of preoject 
dependencies, and an escrow system to ensure coordinate the payment 
transactions via escrow. Based on the type of service requested, the 
system should allow for contracts and authorization workflows to obtain 
permissions to handle matters on behalf of requestor.  A scalable 
solution that provides tools, resources, and a network for individuals 
seeking simplicity in a sovereign state.

A marketplace for work built with an onchain reputation based on 
character, integrity, and respect.  A group purchasing organization.
